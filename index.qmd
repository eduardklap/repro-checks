## Have your paper checked for reproducibility

Do you want to make sure **your next research paper is reproducible**? Then have it checked!

## How does it work?

If you have results from a quantitative analysis that you are about to publish, you can **send the data and code to me for an internal review**. I will perform a code review to see if your code can run on another machine and if it will produce the same output as on your machine.

## Steps for the ESSB Repro Checks

1.  Let me know you are interested and provide some background about your paper or project (via email or the [form](submit.qmd).

2.  If possible, share your data and code on a public repository, so that I can access your materials. In case this is not possible (e.g., for privacy sensitive data), we will figure out an alternative arrangement.

3.  I will try to (computationally)[^1] reproduce the results. This means I will try to regenerate the outputs including figures and tables of your paper.

4.  Based on the previous step, I will provide you with a short feedback report including suggestions on how to increase the reproducibility of your findings.

[^1]: Computational reproducibility means that rerunning the same analysis on the same data should reproduce the same results

Please send me a message via Teams or email (e.klapwijk \[at\] essb.eur.nl) if you are interested in piloting reproducibility checks at ESSB. You can also fill in the form on the [submit your paper](submit.qmd) page and I will contact you.

## The why

**Why is this important?** The repro checks:

-   Ensure a basic quality level of your results (being computationally reproducible).

-   Lower the barrier to share your analysis code with others.

-   Provide you with feedback to improve your data and code.

## Additional resources

If you want to learn more about (computational) reproducibility, please join one of our [workshops](workshops.qmd)! Here are some interesting papers, projects and other resources that might help to get you started:

-   The ESSB Repro Checks are heavily inspired by the following projects:

    -   [CODECHECK](https://codecheck.org.uk/){target="_blank"}

    -   [Reprohack](https://www.reprohack.org){target="_blank"}: Building Communities of Practice in Reproducibility

    -   The [“reproducibility statistician”](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DR35V){target="_blank"} project at the the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex

## Project background

The ESSB Repro Checks are part of the eScience Fellowship project [Implementing institutional reproducibility checks to promote good computational practices](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/fellowship-programme/eduard-klapwijk/ "https://www.esciencecenter.nl/fellowship-programme/eduard-klapwijk/"){target="_blank"} awarded to Eduard Klapwijk, Research Data Steward at ESSB.
