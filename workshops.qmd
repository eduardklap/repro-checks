Together with the [CODECHECKing goes NL](https://www.nwo.nl/projecten/osf232063){target="_blank"} team, we will host a CODECHECK workshop at Erasmus University Rotterdam. For this workshop, we are looking for researchers from the field of social and behavioral sciences based at a Dutch knowledge institution or university **who would like their papers or projects to be “codechecked”** during a live, one-day code-checking workshop on 28 November 2024.

You can participate as a codechecker (i.e., a person reviewing code), or by submitting your own work to be checked (or both if you are up for it!).

*Curious to know how it works? Read about the first [workshop in Delft](https://codecheck.org.uk/nl-workshop1/){target="_blank"}.*

More information to follow on the [CODECHECK-NL](https://codecheck.org.uk/nl/){target="_blank"} webpage.
